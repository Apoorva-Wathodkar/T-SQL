/*
Monitoring read write latancies -----
SQL Server's performence will be impacted if there is extensive read and write latancy on the disk where 
SQL Server data file and log files are present

To review the disk latancy - we can query a DMV sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats
it accepts two parameters database_id and file_id, but accepts null as well to give information about all
the databases.
